![portrait-of-a-strong-woman-in-half-turn-avatar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32a120c1-b31f-4c3a-a775-5a0683f552e9)


ASTRA is a women-centric safety platform that enables instant, discreet emergency response through a web app and wearable integration.
Built for moments when seconds matter and speaking or unlocking a phone isn’t possible.

🚨 Why ASTRA?

1 in 3 women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.
Many incidents occur in everyday environments — walking home, public transport, workplaces, or familiar surroundings.

Traditional safety methods like phone calls or alarms:

Require time and attention

Are not discreet

Fail under panic situations

ASTRA bridges this gap with technology that works silently, instantly, and intelligently.
